The NEW and IMPROVED repo for my personal website, which will basically be a place for me to play with code and try new things all across the board.

I don't write enough in my ReadMe files, and need to change that. So let's do a little update, shall we?
Since it's been... a long time, I've pretty much got the portfolio section of the site done! It's 80% responsive (just need to finish up with the descriptions, which aren't) and needs some copy. Once this is done, I'll be very, VERY happy.
It's been a fun ride. It took a while to get the functionality working, but once I screwed my brain on right I realized it was actually a lot simpler than I was making it out to be. Now it works smoothly, and it's really not that much code at all.
I'm very happy with the design. It looks smooth, and is professional while also showing a bit of my personal brand. A+ there.
I'm not totally sure what I should have in this ReadMe, but this works. 
Next steps: writing the actual copy, and finishing up the responsiveness. Then it can be launched and used as a job searching win!

I've decided it's time for a change! Already... 
Basically I've come up with a new idea for my personal website, and want to see what it would look like. And so far, I'm liking it a lot better than my current portfolio design.
So let's get ready for some changes. Prepare yourselves!
